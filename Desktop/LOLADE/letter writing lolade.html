	<p text align="left"> Dear Sir, </p>
	<p text align="center"> <marquee> <b>LETTER TO MY TEACHER </marquee> </b> </p>
	<p> I just wanted to take some time to express how much i enjoyed being your student. I can't think of a teacher who could have made my past year in school more special than you did.<p>
	<p> You truly are a standout teacher because of your sheer dedication to your students. Especially when teaching math, you always made extra sure that i understood the material, since you knew it was my weakest student. </p>
	<p> My purpose of writing this letter to you is just that i want you to know ever since i left school (Senior Secondary School), i have not es been sitting down at home doing nothing. I have engaged myself in doing some things like
	<li> Learning how to bake </li>
	<li> Learning how to use the computer for web designing, typing, editing and browsing </li> </p>
	<p> Thank you for the great school year and for always going the extra mile as a teacher. I appreciate it more than you will ever know.</p>
	<p> Your truly,</p>
	<p><i> Yusuff Lolade </i></p>
